# Development Vocabulary List

## Description
A structured list describing various development frameworks, technologies, etc.

## Web Development Frameworks, Languages & Technologies
## Frontend
* Reactjs is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. Itâ€™s used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React allows developers to create large web applications which can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in application. This corresponds to view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.
